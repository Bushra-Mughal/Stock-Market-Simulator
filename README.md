# Stock-Market-Simulator
💮 Learn and trade in real-time stock market!

## INTRODUCTION:
As this crowded trading market place might seems confusing to a fresh-man, I introduce you a simple yet effective "python dashboard" webapp which mimics the real-time stock-exchange market and enable users to: <br> <br>
Sell and buy stocks in real-time market place <br>
Check status of their stocks <br>
Review a beginner-friendly market guide.
## An Open-source PROJECT:
You are welcome to contribute in this project.🚀<br><br>
Stock-Market Simulator is a semester project for my DSA course. It uses <B>Queue</B> data structure for resolving <b>Producer-Consumer</b> problem and uses <B>Data Structures</b> in its core. 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
<b>Programming language:</b><br> Python 3 <br>
<b>Libraries:</b><br> streamlit (for dashboard UI) , collections.deque , local modules (class hash_map , class stock_market)<br>
<b>Data Structures:</b> <br>Stack -- for returning "last sold stock"<br>
Hash Map -- for locating stocks in O(1) time<br>
Queue -- for real-time stocks (FIFO principle)
